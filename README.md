<strong>Description of KDS software:</strong><br>
KDS software is freely available. It shows the structural features in the kinase drug pockets that may distinguish one kinase from all others in the human kinome, which is expected benefit the design of the kinase drugs with the desired selectivity. <br>
The KDS software is developed by using the Unity (Unity 2021.3.8f1).<br> 
The 3D assets in the software are generated by Blender 3.1 (python 3.10.2) and PyMol (2.5.2).<br> 
<br><br>
<strong>KDS has three scenes:</strong><br>
  1. Splash screen with Login panel. [animation & network initialization] <br>
  2. Kinase scene showing the binary networks of protein kinases. [real-time visualization & analysis] <br>
  3. Network scene providing the interface for mutations. [data interface & update network]
