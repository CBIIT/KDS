# This is the trial version of KDS (Kinase Drug Selectivity) cross-platform software for review. 
# The full version will be released soon.

Description (@Mingzhen Zhang):
  
    KDS software shows the structural features in the kinase drug pockets that may distinguish one kinase 
    from all others in the human kinome that may benefit the design of the kinase drugs with the desired 
    selectivity. 
    It is developed by using the Unity (Unity 2021.3.8f1). The 3D assets in the software are generated 
    by Blender 3.1 (python 3.10.2) and PyMol (2.5.2).

    KDS has three scenes:
      1. Splash screen with Login panel. [animation & network initialization]
      2. Kinase scene showing the binary networks of protein kinases. [real-time visulazation & analysis]
      3. Network scene providing the interface to introduce mutations. [data interface & update network]
